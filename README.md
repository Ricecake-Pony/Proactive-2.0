## Motivation
> I have a huge passion for helping people and a background in Exercise Science. I used to perform assisted stretching with people from many different backgrounds and demographics to help with their chronic issues or to develop better athleticism. This brings me to Proactive. It was an idea designed to help give insight to people that work from a desk what some common bad habits are that we all do and how to fix them to prevent chronic lower back pain, chronic hip pain, sciatica, and carpal tunnel to name a few. This web application was designed to make it easy for people to have a glimpse of what exercises that can do, how they can track those exercises as a part of a one month challenge and see the benefits and consquences of working from a desk.

## Usage

> Currently using Render/ Postgres for deployment but the deployment is about to expire on Render's server, so only a demo is accesible besides for looking at the code itself. But you can access some of the website created with just the Frontend like the Home Page using:

npm install, cd client, npm start

You can look at the migrations and seeds within the file itself to look at the data on the backend and how it was set up.

## Requirements

- Ruby 3.1.0
- React 18.0.0 or greater

### Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:

```
npm install 
bundle install
